Statistics are a measure of your character's power in a particular field. All stats have a use for some characters. The basic cap (from level 1) is **255**, plus 5 points for every level above 60, bringing us to **280** at level 65, before AAs and Tomes.

[Heroic Power](Alternate Advancement#General Abilities (Shared among all Classes)) AA raises the cap by 5 per rank with 5 ranks, bringing us to **305**. Non-hybrid casters also get the [Innate Enlightenment](Alternate Advancement#General Abilities (Shared among all Classes)) AA, which raises their Intelligence/Wisdom caps by 10 per rank with 5 ranks on top of the Heroic Power boosts, bringing those to a maximum of **355**. Any of these values can be considered a _visible cap_, and your stats will not display as higher than this in-game.

There are further stat-cap increasing AAs found in [Alternate Advancement#Special](Alternate Advancement#Special) that have replaced related Tomes. These AAs all have 6 ranks, and increase **STR**, **DEX**, **CHA**, **AGI**, and **DEX** caps by an additional 5 per rank, bringing your caps in these stats to a maximum of **335**.

Over _visible cap_ statistics for Intelligence and Wisdom can be made useful via two more [special AAs](Alternate Advancement#Special). The AA **Exalted Mind** (available to healers and healer hybrids) will give the player +1% Healing critical rate for every 20 **WIS** over the visible cap, and the AA **Ruinous Mind** will give +1% Spell critical rate for every 20 over-cap **INT**. The AA has four ranks and each rank will grant the player another 1% crit for an additional 20 points over the previous cap. To clarify: Non-hybrid casters will get +4% critical rate if their Intelligence/Wisdom is **435**, and they have completed all four ranks of these AAs. Every other class would only need **385**.

Each character requires a differing set of statistics to accomplish their 'life' missions. Some statistics are more important for one class than another. For instance, warriors require Agility to be a successful tank, however, a wizard would rather have Intelligence on their gear so they have more mana to cast spells.

The statistics that characters live with are determined by the player upon creation of the character and, afterward, can only be modified by [spells](Spells), [items](Category:Items), and [Alternate Advancement](Alternate Advancement) points. All abilities use the human model as the base point, and the different [races](Races) are varied from that base to reflect their unique differences from humans.

## Strength
See also: [Spell: Strength](Spell: Strength)

The statistic **STR**.

**From the in-game description**: Strength is one factor in determining how much damage you do with weapons and special attacks. It directly affects the amount of weight you can carry before suffering penalties.

## Stamina
See also: [Spell: Stamina](Spell: Stamina)

The statistic **STA**. [Hit points](Hit points) per point of stamina is both level and class dependent.

Stamina also affects the length of the stamina bar (this bar is yellow and found underneath hitpoint and mana bars in the default UI). This bar is essentially a timer for many [Styles](Melee Styles) for melee classes.

There are spells available to decrease the stamina used by styles, however, there is no way to increase the stamina regeneration rate.

**From the in-game description**: Stamina increases your maximum [hit points](hit points).

## Agility
See also: [Spell: Agility](Spell: Agility)

The statistic **AGI**.

**From the in-game description**: Agility is one factor in determining your avoidanceâ€”how often foes will miss when trying to hit you. Agility also affects movement speed and defensive skill ups. If your agility is below 75 you will move slower than normal but having agility 75 or higher allows you to move at a normal pace.

## Dexterity
See also: [Spell: Dexterity](Spell: Dexterity)

The formula **DEX + Weapon Skill + [Offense](Offense)** is used to determine the chance to hit. Dexterity does **not** affect [proc](proc) chance. Procs are dependent on the individual weapon or buff and, for Bards, an AA.

**From the in-game description**: Dexterity is a factor in determining how often you will hit foes in [melee](melee) combat.

## Wisdom
**Wisdom (WIS)** is the primary spell-casting attribute for [Paladins](Paladin), [Rangers](Ranger), [Beastlords](Beastlord), [Clerics](Cleric), [Shamans](Shaman), and [Druids](Druid). It affects how much [mana](mana) these [classes](classes) have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest ([meditate](meditate)). Wisdom also determines how often a spell will [fizzle](fizzle) for these classes or, in other words, fail to cast.

You receive 12 mana per **WIS** up to 200 **WIS** at level 65.

You receive 6 mana per **WIS** for **WIS** 201+ until the visible cap at level 65.

**From the in-game description**: Wisdom affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your Intelligence.

## Intelligence
**Intelligence (INT)** is the primary spell-casting attribute for [Shadow Knights](Shadow Knight), [Bards](Bard), [Wizards](Wizard), [Enchanters](Enchanter), [Necromancers](Necromancer), and [Magicians](Magician). It affects how much [mana](mana) these [classes](classes) have, which determines how many spells they can cast before they must rest ([meditate](meditate)). For all except Bards, it also determines how often a spell will [fizzle](fizzle) or, in other words, fail to cast.

You receive 12 mana per **INT** up to 200 **INT** at level 65.

You receive 6 mana per **INT** for **INT** 201+ until the visible cap at level 65.

**From the in-game description**: Intelligence affects your chances of gaining skill points in most skills, if it is higher than your Wisdom.

## Charisma
The statistic **CHA**.

**From the in-game description**: Charisma affects how much certain (the [Charms](Charms) vendor) [merchants](merchant) will charge you for their wares. Additionally, it plays a significant factor in how resistant foes will be to your spells. It also helps with some [skills](skills) such as [Intimidation](Intimidation).
